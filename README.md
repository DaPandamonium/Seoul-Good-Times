# Seoul Good Eats - Codédex HTML Course Final Project

Welcome to the Seoul Good Eats website, the culmination of my journey through the Codédex HTML course. This project represents the application of skills and concepts learned throughout the course, focusing on creating a rich, semantic, and accessible web experience.

## About The Project

Seoul Good Eats is a fictional restaurant website dedicated to offering an immersive introduction to Korean cuisine. Designed solely with HTML, this project emphasizes the power of semantic web design, structured content, and accessibility standards.

### Features

- **Semantic HTML:** Utilizes HTML5 semantic elements to structure the website, improving accessibility and SEO.
- **Interactive Menu Section:** A detailed menu showcases Korean dishes, employing `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<details>` tags for engaging content exploration.
- **Image Gallery:** An HTML-based gallery (`<figure>` and `<figcaption>`) tells the story behind "Seoul Good Times," the inspiration for our restaurant's theme.
- **Contact and Order Form:** Demonstrates form creation with `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<textarea>`, including validation attributes.

### Educational Objectives

This project aims to:
- Demonstrate the use of semantic HTML elements and their importance in web development.
